## Bit manipulation
+ & return 1 when both are 1, otherwise 0
+ | return 0 when both are 0, otherwise 1
+ ~ return 0 when bit is 1 and 1 when bit is 0 (NOT)
+ ^ both value are the same -> 0, otherwise 1 (XOR)

+ << left shifting: remove bit on the left -> Calc value x 2 to the power of shifting value
+ >> right shift: remove bit on the right -> Calc: value / 2 to the power of shifting value
